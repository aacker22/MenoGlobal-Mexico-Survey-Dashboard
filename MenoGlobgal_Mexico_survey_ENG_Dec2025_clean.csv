Comments like that take away from the woman as an individual and human. Menopause should not be seen as something ""negative"", aging fully is essential, and giving women a dignified menopause where they are not made to feel bad for losing their reproductive capacity or advancing in age is extremely important, since the value of a woman is not reduced to being a mother or being young. Due to this shame, many women also neglect their physical health, and it is essential that they also attend medical check-ups.
